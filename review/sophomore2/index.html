            <p>For this project, I chose to create a typographic website featuring texts from a reading 'In Praise of Shadows,' written by Junichiro Tanizaki. During my thought process, I delved into the essence of shadows and how they are created. Shadows exist because we live in a 3-dimensional world, so I decided to incorporate 3D elements into my website. Additionally, I focused on the flow of the text, emphasizing the placement of large text elements while ensuring all necessary text was included. Furthermore, I aimed to make the design playful by incorporating user interaction features such as graphics that follow the mouse and hover effects.</p>
