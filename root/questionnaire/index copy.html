        <li>Describe your previous experiences with coding. What classes have you already taken where you were exposed
            to HTML/CSS/JS? What parts of the class resonated with you? What parts were most confusing?</li>
            <p>I had Core1 interaction class last semester and I learned the basic html and css skills there.</p>
        <li>How excited about learning code are you? Are you nervous about learning code? If so, why? What can I do in
            this class to help reduce this anxiety?</li>
            <p>I am excited to learn an advance coding, however, what I am worried about is that I am bad at fundamental skills, so I always
                struggle to visualize my design to webpage although I have initial designs in my head. </p>
        <li>How do you imagine coding fitting in with the rest of your design curriculum and career after college?</li>
            <p> I think learning coding can make me capable of ui/ux or othere webpage deisgns so it will help me in those digital design career.</p>
        <li>What text editor do you prefer to use?</li>
            <p>I prefer using Visual Stuido code</p>
        <li>Have you used GitHub before? Do you know what it is? Describe your understanding of GitHub.</li>
            <p>Yes. I used it in my last semester coding class. I barely understand what it was because I was just following the steps my professor gave, not knowing what was i doing.</p> 
        <li>Describe the relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Try using a unique analogy to describe this
            relationship. Bonus points for creative analogies.</li>
            <p> html is a language for creating web documents that are visible to the user through a web browser and focuses on the content creation of web documents, which is the basic framework for creating web documents. 
                Css is a language that designs websites by adding or changing various shapes to an existing html, focusing on the shape representation of web documents. In other words, if html is the basic framework, then css is the concept of putting a design on the framework.
                JavaScript focuses on the action provided to web documents in a language used for functional elements such as opening pop-up windows or checking phone numbers or e-mail addresses, in addition to linking web documents using html. In other words, JavaScript is a concept that puts movement in framework + design.
                Think of a mannequin. A pure mannequin in no clothes is Html, a pretty dress to wear to the mannequin is Css, and the process of moving the limbs of the mannequin to pose is JavaScript.

                  <p>Cameron's World is a nostalgic trip back to the early days of the internet. It's an archive of websites from the 1990s, filled with colorful backgrounds, animated GIFs, and y2k design elements. This site reminds me of the playful and experimental aesthetic of web design in early 2000s interent.</p>

        <li>Insert a video embed into the page (for example, a YouTube or Vimeo embed tag of a video of your choosing).
            You have a few ways you can approach this:
            <ul>
                <li>Look into the `iframe` tag. Hint: If using a YouTube or Vimeo video, you can copy the embed code from
                    each video’s page.</li>
                <li>Use a `video` tag, though finding the URL of a video can sometimes be tricky – do you best to download,
                    place it in your project folder, then reference its file path</li>

        <li>Nest the following series of HTML tags inside each other, where each → represents a new level. Make sure to
            maintain proper indentation.
