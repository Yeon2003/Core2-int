                <div class="cube-face front">In making for ourselves a place to live, we first spread a parasol to throw a shadow on the earth, and in the pale light of the shadow we put together a house. There are of course roofs on Western houses too, but they are less to keep off the sun than to keep off the wind and the dew; even from without it is apparent that they are built to create as few shadows as possible and to expose the interior to as much light as possible. If <span class= 'bigger'>t</span>he roof of a Japanese house is a parasol, the roof of a Western house is no more t<span class= 'bigger'>h</span>an a cap, with as small a visor as possible so as to allow the sunlight to penetrat<span class= 'bigger'>e</span> directly beneath the eaves. There are no doubt all sorts of reasons-climate, building materials-for the deep Japanese eaves. The fact that we did not use glass, concrete, and bricks, for instance, made a low roof necessary to keep off the driving wind and rain. A light room would no doubt have been more convenient for us, too, than a dark room. The <span class= 'bigger'>q</span>uality that we call beauty, however, must always grow from the realities of life, and o<span class= 'bigger'>u</span>r ancestors, forced to live in dark rooms, presently came to discover beauty in sh<span class= 'bigger'>a</span>dows, ultimately to guide shadows towards beauty's ends. And so it has come to be that the beauty of a Japanese room depends on a variation of shadows, heavy shadows against light shadows-it has nothing else. Westerners are amazed at the simp<span class= 'bigger'>l</span>ic<span class= 'bigger'>i</span>ty of Japanese rooms, perceiving in them no more than ashen walls bereft of ornament. 
                </div>
                <div class="cube-face back">We have all had the experience, on a visit to one of the great temples of Kyoto or Nara, of being shown a scroll, one of the temple's treasures, hanging in a large, deeply recessed alcove. So dark are these alcoves, even in bright daylight, that we can hardly discern the outlines of the work; all we can do is listen to the explanation of the guide, follow as best we can the all-but invisible brush <span class= 'bigger'>s</span>trokes, and tell ourselves how magnificent a painting it must be.<span class= 'bigger'>Y</span> the combination of that blurred old painting and the dark alcove is one of absolute harmony. The lack of clarity, far from disturbing us, seems rather to suit the painting perfectly. For the painting here is nothing more than <span class= 'bigger'>a</span>nother delicate surface upon which the faint, frail light can play; it performs precisely the same function as the sand-textured wall. This is <span class= 'bigger'>w</span>hy we attach such importance to age and patina. A new painting, even one done in ink monochrome or subtle pastels, can quite destroy the shadows of an alcove, unless it is selected with the greatest care.A Japanese room might be <span class= 'bigger'>l</span>ikened to an inkwash painting, the paper-paneled shoji being the expanse where the ink is thinnest, and the alcove where it is darkest. Whenever I see the <span class= 'bigger'>a</span>lcove of a tastefully built Japanese room, I marvel at our comprehension of the secrets of shadows, our sensitive use of shadow and light. For the beauty of the alcove is not the work of some clever device. An empty space is marked off with plain wood and plain walls, so that the light drawn into it forms dim shadows within emptiness.
                </div>
                <div class="cube-face left">There is nothin<span class= 'bigger'>g</span> more. And yet, when we gaze into the darkness that gathers behind the crossbeam, around the flower vase, beneath the shelves, though we know perfectly well it is mere shadow, we are overcome with the feeling that in this small corner o<span class= 'bigger'>f</span> the atmosphe<span class= 'bigger'>r</span>e there reigns complete and utter silence; that here in the darkness immutable tranquility h<span class= 'bigger'>o</span>lds sway. The "mysterious Orient" of which Westerners speak p<span class= 'bigger'>r</span>obably refers to the uncanny silence of these dark places. And even we as children w<span class= 'bigger'>o</span>uld feel an inexpressible chill as <span class= 'bigger'>w</span>e peered into the depths of an alcove to which the sunlight had never penetrated. Where lies the key to this mystery? illtimately it is the <span class= 'bigger'>m</span>agic of shadows. Were <span class= 'bigger'>the</span> shadows to be banished from its comers, the alcove would in that instant revert to mere void.

                    This was the genius of our ancestors, that by cutting off the light from this empty space they imparted to the world of shadows that formed there a quality of mystery and depth superior to that of any wall painting or ornament. The technique seems simple, but was by no means so simply achieved. We can imagine with little difficulty what extraordinary pains were taken with each invisible detail-the placement of the window in the shelving recess, the depth of the crossbeam, the height of the threshold. But for me the most exquisite touch is-the pale white glow of the shoji in the study bay; I need only pause before it and I forget the passage of time.
                    
                </div>
                <div class="cube-face right">The hue may differ from room to room, <span class= 'bigger'>b</span>ut the degree of difference will be ever so slight; not so much a difference in color as in shade, a difference that will seem to exist only in the mood of the vi<span class= 'bigger'>e</span>wer. And from these delicate differences in the hue of the walls, the shadows in e<span class= 'bigger'>a</span>ch room take on a tinge peculiarly their own. Of course the Japanese room does have its picture alcove, and in it a hanging scroll and a flower arrangement. B<span class= 'bigger'>u</span>t the scroll and the flowers serve not as ornament but rather to give depth to the shadows. We value a scroll above all for the way it blends with the walls of <span class= 'bigger'>t</span>he alcove, and thus we consider the mounting quite as important as the calligraph<span class= 'bigger'>y</span> or painting. Even the greatest masterpiece will lose its worth as a scroll if it fails to blend with the alcove, while a work of no particular distinction <span class= 'bigger'>m</span>ay blend beautifully with the room and set off to unexpected advantage both itself and its surroundings. 
                    Wherein lies the power of an otherwise ordinary work to prod<span class= 'bigger'>u</span>ce such an effect? Most often the paper, the ink, the fabric of the mounting will posses<span class= 'bigger'>s</span> a cer<span class= 'bigger'>t</span>ain look of antiquity, and this look of antiquity will strike just the right balance with the darkness of the alcove and room.

                </div>
                <div class="cube-face top">The study bay, as the name suggests, was originally a projecting window built to p<span class= 'bigger'>r</span>ovide a place for reading. Over the years it came to be regarded as no more than a sourc<span class= 'bigger'>e</span> of light for the alcove; but most often it serves not so much to illuminate the alcove <span class= 'bigger'>a</span>s to soften the sidelong rays from without, to filter them through paper panels. There is a co<span class= 'bigger'>l</span>d and desolate tinge to the light by the time it reaches these panels. The little sunl<span class= 'bigger'>i</span>ght from the garden that manages to make its way beneath the eaves and through <span class= 'bigger'>t</span>he corridors has by then lost its power to il<span class= 'bigger'>l</span>uminate, seems drained of the complexion of l<span class= 'bigger'>i</span>fe. It can do no more than accentuate the wh<span class= 'bigger'>i</span>teness of the paper. I sometimes ling<span class= 'bigger'>e</span>r before these panels and study the surface o<span class= 'bigger'>f</span> the paper, bright, but giving no impres<span class= 'bigger'>s</span>ion <span class= 'bigger'>of</span> brilliance.In temple archit<span class= 'bigger'>e</span>cture the main room stands at a considerable distance from the garden; so dilute is the light there that no matter what the season, on fair days or cloudy, morning, midday, or evening, the pale, white glow scarcely varies.


                </div>
                <div class="cube-face bottom">Their reaction is understandable, but it betrays a failure to comprehend the mystery of shadows. Out beyond the sitting room, which the rays of the sun can at best but barely reach, we extend the eaves or build on a veranda, putting <span class="bigger">t</span>he sunlight at still greater a remove. The light from the garden steals in but diml<span class= 'bigger'>y</span><br> <span class= 'bigger'>t</span>hrough paper-paneled doors, and it is precisely this indirect light that makes for us t<span class= 'bigger'>h</span>e charm of a room. We do our walls in neutral colors so that the sad, fragile, dying r<span class= 'bigger'>a</span>ys can sink into absolute repose. The storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and such may have a glossy finish, but the walls of the sitting room will almost always be of day tex<span class= 'bigger'>t</span>ured with fine sand. A luster here would destroy the soft fragile beauty of the feeble light. <span class= 'bigger'>We</span> delight in the mere sight of the delicate glow of fading rays <span class= 'bigger'>c</span>linging to the surface of a dusky wall, there to live out what lttle life remains to them. We never tire of the sight, for to us this pale glow and these dim shadows far surpass <span class= 'bigger'>a</span>ny ornament. And so, as we must if we are not to disturb the glow, we finish the wa<span class= 'bigger'>l</span><span class= 'bigger'>l</span>s with sand in a single neutral color.
