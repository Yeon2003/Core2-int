    <p class="p"> I possess no specialized knowledge of architecture, but I understand that <span class= 'bigger'>in</span> the Gothic cathedral of the West, the roof is thrust u<span class= 'bigger'>p</span>and up so as to place its pinnacle as high in the heavens as possible-and that he<span class= 'bigger'>r</span>ein is thought to lie its special beauty. In the temples of Japan, on the other hand, a roof of heavy tiles is first laid out, and in the deep, spacious shadows cre<span class= 'bigger'>a</span>ted by the eaves the rest of the structure is built. Nor is this true only of temples; <span class= 'bigger'>i</span>n the palaces of the nobility and the house<span class= 'bigger'>s</span> of the common people, what first <span class= 'bigger'>s</span>trikes the eye is the massive ro<span class= 'bigger'>of</span> of tile or t<span class= 'bigger'>h</span>atch and the heavy darkn<span class= 'bigger'>e</span>ss that hangs beneath the eaves. Even at midday c<span class= 'bigger'>a</span>vernous darkness spreads over all beneath the roof's edge, making entryway, <span class= 'bigger'>d</span>oors, walls, and pillars all but invisible. The grand temples of Kyoto-Chion'in, Honganji-and the farmhouses of the remote countryside are alike in this respect: like m<span class= 'bigger'>o</span>st buildings of the past their roofs give the impression of possessing far greater <span class= 'bigger'>w</span>eight, height, and surface than all that stands beneath the eave<span class= 'bigger'>s</span>. </p>
