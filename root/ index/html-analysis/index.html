      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <div class="grid-col-2">
        <div>

          <p> header<br> main data-barba aria-live <br> div<br>ul <br> id <br> section<br> img <br> h1 <br> h2 <br> address <br> span <br> aria-hidden <br> picture <br> h3<br> footer<br> svg </p>
          </pre>
        </div>
        <div id="analysis--text">
          <p> On the very top of the website, there are texts class= "nav-mask" is applied, and it makes us able to move to another page when clicked. Especially, ul is used to arrange the "Product", "Packagong", and "About Us" within the even space. <br>
            h1, h2, and adress tag in here are for the small texts under those text bar.<br> 
            Section tag overally wraps the title page, where the web site name and subheading are. <br>
            I can also see span is used to differenciate the one letter"N" in the subheading, to add more style in the typography and aesthetic.<br>
            The bottle in the middle of the title used picture tag and has classes "uncut" and "cut", so when we scroll down, we can see the uncut bottle photo.<br>
            The section tag warps the each section where the items are advertised.

      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          1. What is the reason he is using section tag instead of div and make containers?
          2. It seems like he used image from webp. what is that? what happens if the image from that web change? does that affect this website?
          3. what does "data-barba" and "aria-live" mean?
